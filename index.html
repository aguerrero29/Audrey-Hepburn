        Audrey Kathleen Hepburn (née Ruston; 4 May 1929 – 20 January 1993) was a
        British[a] actress. Recognised as a film and fashion icon, she was
        ranked by the American Film Institute as the third-greatest female
        screen legend from the Classical Hollywood cinema and was inducted into
        the International Best Dressed Hall of Fame List. Born in Ixelles,
        Brussels, to an aristocratic family, Hepburn spent parts of her
        childhood in Belgium, England, and the Netherlands. She attended
        boarding school in Kent, England, from 1936 to 1939. With the outbreak
        of World War II, she returned to the Netherlands.[3] During the war, she
        studied ballet at the Arnhem Conservatory, and by 1944, she performed
        ballet to raise money to support the Dutch resistance.[4] She studied
        ballet with Sonia Gaskell in Amsterdam beginning in 1945, and with Marie
        Rambert in London from 1948. She began performing as a chorus girl in
        West End musical theatre productions and then had minor appearances in
        several films. She rose to stardom in the romantic comedy Roman Holiday
        (1953) alongside Gregory Peck, for which she was the first actress to
        win an Oscar, a Golden Globe Award, and a BAFTA Award for a single
        performance. That year, she also won a Tony Award for Best Lead Actress
        in a Play for her performance in Ondine.
